# Python Programs

This repository has the Python programs I made while learning the language. 

You can follow along or use these as references for your own projects. I posted these for myself and others to reference.

*Side note: I best learn by doing rather than reading so I tend to teach myself by trial and error. I hope this is not to chaotic for anyone.
